    <h1>Three days later...</h1>
   
    <h2>You have adopted a puppy from the local shelter, and you are taking him out for a walk.</h2>

    <h2>You pass the forest where you lost your old pal. You hear a twig snap.</h2>
    <h2>A bush by the edge of the woods starts shaking, and you see your first dog jump out!</h2>

    <h2>Your grin grows wider than the Grand Canyon as run to her to hug her close.</h2> 
    <h2>But she sees your new dog, and growls at you, feeling betrayed.</h2>

    <h2>You never should have given up on looking for her!</h2>
    <h2>Hope you learned your lesson. What a cruel heart you have.</h2>
